1. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create a virtual environment named env:

python -m venv env

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
source env/Scripts/activate



3. Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required packages in the virtual environment. For example:

pip install numpy pandas



4. Save Dependencies
Export the installed packages to a requirements.txt file for reproducibility:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


5. Use the Environment in the Future
Activate the Environment:
Each time you work on the project, activate the virtual environment first:

env\Scripts\activate  # Windows




Install Dependencies from requirements.txt:
If you're sharing the project or setting it up on a new machine, install dependencies like this:

pip install -r requirements.txt


6. Deactivate the Environment
When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment:

deactivate




GPT recommend but no testyet.

Recommendation for Your Case
Since you're using a venv and already have a requirements.txt:

Stick with pip and venv: Use requirements.txt for dependency installation:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Switch to Poetry Later (Optional): If you decide you want the advanced features of Poetry (e.g., dependency management or publishing packages), you can transition by:

Initializing Poetry:
poetry init
Converting requirements.txt to pyproject.toml with:
poetry add $(cat requirements.txt | xargs)

pip install --upgrade pip
